## Information

### What is this?

An app that displays information for football teams, displaying information about football teams such as: it's name, logo, squad and upcoming fixures.

### What can you do?

The user can select from a list of teams and display it's squad, upcoming fixures, it's logo and name.

## Notes from the developer

The exercise was fun, but I have to say that the API was quite problematic, especially with regards to the varying amounts of data sent with each call, the amount of modelling required and the team's logos in SVG format, which proved to be more problematic in Swift than I anticipated.
I wish I had more time to add more functionality such as search, favourite team, more information in the team view and to add some more fluff in general.

## Usage Instructions

### Requirements to run

- XCode 12.5.1 and above.
- Device/Simulator running iOS 14.5 and above.
- Cocoapods 1.10.1 or above.

### How to run

- Clone the repository or download the zip.
- Launch the 364Scores.xcworkspace
- Build and run the project on a simulator or a connected device.

## The Exercise

Your task is to create a football information app supporting the following requirements:

● A splash screen will be shown when the app is launched. Use whatever image you want for the splash screen.

● The app’s main screen will show a list of football teams. When a team is selected, the app will show:

o The team’s logo

o Names of players in the team

o A list of 10 (or fewer) upcoming matches for the team. You should show the name of the rival team, the date, and the competition (Champions League, Primera Division, etc.).

o Each of the above should be shown in its own View, but all should be visible in the main screen. Use scrollbars if needed.

For this exercise, you should implement the app in Swift.
Football information is available from https://www.football-data.org/.
